## üìã 3-Step Deployment Plan

### Step 1: Verify Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/georgemarlow/Documents/Coding/Score/score-vision

# 1. Check CUDA is available
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA Available:', torch.cuda.is_available()); print('GPU:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'N/A')"

# Expected output:
# CUDA Available: True
# GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti
```

**If CUDA is not available:**
- Install/update NVIDIA drivers
- Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support: `pip install torch --upgrade --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`

---

### Step 2: Benchmark Performance (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Quick benchmark (2 minutes)
python scripts/benchmark_miner.py --video-url "YOUR_TEST_VIDEO_URL" --quick

# OR with local video
python scripts/benchmark_miner.py --video-path /path/to/test.mp4
```

**Expected Results (RTX 5070 Ti):**
```
Rank   FPS      Time     Batch    Stride   ImgSize    Memory    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      187.50   4.00s    32       2        640        8.2 GB

RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION:
  Batch Size: 32
  Frame Stride: 2
  Image Size: 640px
  Expected Time (750 frames): 4.0s
  Speedup vs baseline: 20-40x
```

**If benchmark fails or shows poor performance:**
- See troubleshooting section below
- Check GPU is not being used by other applications
- Verify you have enough free VRAM (8+ GB)

---

### Step 3: Deploy Miner (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/georgemarlow/Documents/Coding/Score/score-vision/miner

# Start with default optimized settings
python main.py
```

**Watch for these log messages:**
```
‚úÖ Success indicators:
[INFO] GPU optimizations applied successfully (GPU mem: 90%, CPU threads: 32)
[INFO] Using batch processing with batch_size=32
[INFO] Video processor initialized with cuda device, timeout: 10800.0s, prefetch=64, frame_stride=2
[INFO] Processed 100 frames in 0.8s (125.00 fps)
[INFO] Completed processing 375 frames (stride=2) in 3.0s (125.00 fps)

‚ùå Warning signs:
[WARNING] CUDA not available
[ERROR] CUDA out of memory
[WARNING] Processing took longer than expected
```

---

## üéõÔ∏è Optional: Fine-Tuning

If you want to customize settings, use environment variables:

### Maximum Speed Mode
```bash
export BATCH_SIZE=64
export IMG_SIZE=512
export FRAME_STRIDE=3
python main.py
```
**Target:** <2s per video, highest FPS

### Balanced Mode (Default - Recommended)
```bash
# Already set as defaults, no env vars needed
python main.py
```
**Target:** 2-4s per video, best speed/accuracy balance

### High Accuracy Mode
```bash
export BATCH_SIZE=32
export IMG_SIZE=800
export FRAME_STRIDE=1
python main.py
```
**Target:** 5-8s per video, maximum accuracy

---

## üîç Monitoring Performance

### Real-Time GPU Monitoring

**Terminal 1: Run miner**
```bash
cd /Users/georgemarlow/Documents/Coding/Score/score-vision/miner
python main.py
```

**Terminal 2: Monitor GPU**
```bash
watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi
```

**What to look for:**
- GPU Utilization: Should be **80-95%** during processing
- GPU Memory: Should use **8-12 GB** (out of 16 GB)
- Temperature: Keep under 85¬∞C for best performance

|----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **RTX 5070 Ti (You)** | 2-4s | 125-250 | ‚úÖ Highly Competitive |
| RTX 4090 | 1-2s | 250-500 | üèÜ Top Tier |
| RTX 3080 | 4-6s | 80-150 | ‚úÖ Competitive |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "CUDA out of memory"

**Solution 1: Reduce batch size**
```bash
export BATCH_SIZE=16  # or 8
python main.py
```

**Solution 2: Reduce image size**
```bash
export BATCH_SIZE=32
export IMG_SIZE=512
python main.py
```

**Solution 3: Close other GPU applications**
- Chrome/Firefox with GPU acceleration
- Other mining/ML applications
- Gaming applications

---

### Problem: "Still processing in 10+ seconds"

**Diagnostic steps:**

1. **Verify CUDA is being used:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
# Must be True
```

2. **Check GPU utilization during processing:**
```bash
nvidia-smi
# GPU should show 80-95% utilization
```

3. **Run full benchmark:**
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_miner.py --video-path test.mp4
# Compare results against expected
```

4. **Check for thermal throttling:**
```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=temperature.gpu --format=csv
# Should be under 85¬∞C
```

5. **Verify batch size is being used:**
```bash
# Check logs for:
# "Using batch processing with batch_size=32"
```

---

### Problem: "Low accuracy / missing detections"

**Solution: Increase quality settings**
```bash
export FRAME_STRIDE=1  # Process all frames
export IMG_SIZE=800     # Higher resolution
python main.py
```

**Note:** This will slow down processing to 5-8s but improve accuracy.

---

### Problem: "Download taking too long"

**Check:**
1. Internet connection speed (should be 50+ Mbps)
2. Google Drive rate limiting (may need to wait)
3. Network latency to validator

**Optimize:**
- Use wired connection instead of WiFi
- Close other bandwidth-heavy applications
- Consider getting closer to validator geographically
